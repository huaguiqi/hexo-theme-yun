But then this also means the increase of the workload, and more consideration and testing will be required. So eventually I choose to prioritize the development of the bright theme.</p><blockquote><p>Some scientific research as early as the 1980s showed that for most users, the heavy use of bright background text seems to be a more effective choice. D. Bauer and C. R. Cavonius shared their research results in the journal &quot;Improving the legibility of visual display elements through contrast inversion&quot; (1980) with their topic on how advertising vehicles operate. In particular, they found that when reading text, participants improved accuracy by 26% when browsing dark text with light backgrounds. Why is this happening? Jason Harrison from the &quot;Sensory Perception and Interaction Research Group&quot; at the University of Lumbia, UK, explained this phenomenon in the following way: People with astigmatism (according to various data, approximately 50% of the population has this) feel that text on a black background is more difficult to perceive than black text on a white background, which is related to the brightness level. On a bright display (white background), the iris will be slightly closed, reducing the effect of &quot;anamorphic&quot; lenses; on a darker display (black background), the iris will open and receive more light, and then the distortion of the lens will make the focal length of the eyes more blurred. Therefore, if there is a large amount of text on the interface, and the user needs to read for a long time, then using a lighter background will make the user feel more comfortable.</p></blockquote><h2 id="thanks"><a class="header-anchor" href="#thanks">#</a> Thanks</h2><h3 id="project"><a class="header-anchor" href="#project">#</a> Project</h3>',6),V={href:"https://www.jsdelivr.com/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},z=(0,o.Uk)("jsDelivr – Open Source CDN"),E={href:"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},G=(0,o.Uk)("Hexo"),J={href:"https://github.com/Remix-Design/remixicon",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},K=(0,o.Uk)("RemixIcon"),B={href:"https://www.iconfont.cn/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Q=(0,o.Uk)("iconfont"),M={href:"https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightgallery.js/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},X=(0,o.Uk)("lightgallery.js"),Z={href:"https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},F=(0,o.Uk)("VuePress"),$={href:"https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ee=(0,o.Uk)("KaTeX"),te={href:"https://github.com/MoOx/pjax",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},re=(0,o.Uk)("Pjax"),oe=(0,o.Wm)("h3",{id:"theme"},[(0,o.Wm)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#theme"},"#"),(0,o.Uk)(" Theme")],-1),ne=(0,o.Uk)("-"),ae={href:"https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},le=(0,o.Uk)("hexo-theme-next"),ie=(0,o.Uk)(" -"),se={href:"https://github.com/Molunerfinn/hexo-theme-melody",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},he=(0,o.Uk)("hexo-theme-melody"),ue=(0,o.Uk)(" -"),me={href:"https://github.com/honjun/hexo-theme-sakura",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ce=(0,o.Uk)("hexo-theme-sakura"),pe=(0,o.Wm)("h3",{id:"pv"},[(0,o.Wm)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#pv"},"#"),(0,o.Uk)(" PV")],-1),de=(0,o.Uk)("-"),ge={href:"https://www.bilibili.com/video/av4018008",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},fe=(0,o.Uk)("[Luo Tianyi original] The strange storm center [Sugita Lang]"),ke=(0,o.Uk)(" -[[Luo Tianyi Original] Starry Time][Sugita Lang]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av7036967)"),be=(0,o.Wm)("h3",{id:"article"},[(0,o.Wm)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#article"},"#"),(0,o.Uk)(" Article")],-1),ye=(0,o.Uk)("-"),We={href:"https://molunerfinn.com/make-a-hexo-theme/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ve=(0,o.Uk)("Hexo theme development experience talk"),we=(0,o.Wm)("h2",{id:"hexo-vs-wordpress-vs-typecho"},[(0,o.Wm)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#hexo-vs-wordpress-vs-typecho"},"#"),(0,o.Uk)(" Hexo VS WordPress VS Typecho")],-1),Ue=(0,o.Wm)("p",null,"The so-called existence is reasonable.",-1),xe=(0,o.Wm)("p",null,"This theme is a theme of Hexo.
